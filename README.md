# Logistics-App
Project Description

Design and implement a Logistics console application.

The application will be used by employees of a large Australian company aiming to expand its activities to the freight industry. The app

 will be used to manage the delivery of packages between hubs in major Australian cities. An employee of the company must be able to record 

the details of a delivery package, create or search for suitable delivery routes, and inspect the current state of delivery packages, 

transport vehicles and delivery routes. 

Functional Requirements

The application must support the following operations:

Creating a delivery package – unique id, start location, end location and weight in kg, and contact information for the customer.

The first location is the starting location – it has a departure time.

The other locations have expected arrival time.

Search for a route based on package’s start and end locations.

Updating a delivery route – assign a free truck to it.

Updating a delivery route – assign a delivery package.
